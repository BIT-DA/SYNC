## Contributions

- By taking a novel causal perspective towards EDG problem, we design a time-aware SCM that enables the refined modeling of both dynamic causal factors and causal mechanism drifts. After that, we propose **S**tatic-D**YN**amic **C**ausal Representation Learning (**SYNC**), an approach for effectively learning time-aware causal representations, thereby mitigating spurious correlations.
- Theoretically, we show that SYNC can build the optimal causal predictor for each time domain, resulting in improved model generalization.
- Results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, along with extensive analytic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.

## Prerequisites Installation

The code is implemented with `Python 3.8.18` and run on `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090`. To try out this project, it is recommended to set up a virtual environment first.

```
# Step-by-step installation
conda create -n sync python=3.8.18
conda activate sync

# install torch, torchvision and torchaudio
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch -c conda-forge

# this installs required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
